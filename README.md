# Personal Website

My public website, powered by the [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte) template on the latest version of SvelteKit.

## Developing

After cloning the project and installing dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

Note: the website is currently hosted using Netlify and is live [`here`](https://safeer.tech).
